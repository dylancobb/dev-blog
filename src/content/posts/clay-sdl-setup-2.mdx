Since we're going to need a couple of related libraries later, so let's install them now. We need to go through a similar process for [`SDL_ttf`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) and [`SDL_image`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image).

First, we'll build and install `SDL_ttf`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf
cd SDL_ttf
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local
```

Now, we'll build and install `SDL_image`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image
cd SDL_ttf
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local
```

As with the main library, you may have to install missing dependencies first.

## The case for Clay

SDL is quite a small, low-level library. It's not a framework or a GUI toolkit, and doesn't provide any tools to manage the layout of the components that make up your user interface on screen. Personally, I really appreciate the tree-based way we build UI in the browser with HTML and CSS. I especially like the [flexbox layout module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts), as it's very intuitive to reason around the placement of objects in flex-based layouts.

[Clay](https://www.nicbarker.com/clay) is a renderer-agnostic library created by the brilliant Nic Barker, and brings the joys of `<div class="flex">` soup to C developers. It's insanely cool, but I'll let Nic sell it to you:

<div style="padding-block: 2rem;">

</div>
