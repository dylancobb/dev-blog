It's natural when learning a new skill to set overly ambitious goals, and start gargantuan projects you're very unlikely to see through to completion. You picked up the guitar, and decided you want to open at Wembley arena. You watched a few coding tutorials and decide you wanted to make a commercial video game by yourself.

For me, it's an "extensible music composition environment". Ever since I started my coding journey in 2023, I've wanted to build a program where users can enter, generate, organise and transform musical content. It'd be cross-platform, render notation, play audio, and provide ways to add new functionality. I actually built [Meantonal](../projects/meantonal), [Cangen](../projects/cangen) and [Cantussy](../projects/cantussy) as part of this long-term goal.

In this post, I'll be taking another small step by setting up an SDL3 and Clay project, creating a window, and drawing some text and graphics on the screen.

## The case for SDL

Sadly, my current experience writing desktop applications lies in stark contrast with these lofty goals. In fact, it occurred to me that, after nearly three years spent mostly on web dev, the only way I know to draw a rectangle on the screen looks something like this:

```html title="some-page.html"
<div>
  <!-- content goes here -->
</div>
```

Granted, that'll run anywhere there's a web browser to render it, but how *do* you do something as simple as create a window or process user keypress events in a desktop application written in a language like C or C++?

As it turns out, that’s where something like [SDL](https://libsdl.org/) comes in. SDL is a C library that abstracts away the tedious, platform-specific parts of desktop development—creating a window, opening a GPU-backed render context, and receiving keyboard, mouse, and controller input—behind a single, consistent API. The same code runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, and beyond. It gives you just enough to talk to the OS and the hardware, while staying out of your way so you can focus on your own rendering, layout, and application logic.

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-block: 2rem;">
    <Layers />
</div>

I'm going to use SDL3 as the backbone of my application. Let's walk through building and installing SDL3, and setting up a project with SDL3.

## The case for Clay

SDL is quite a small, low-level library. It's not a framework or a GUI toolkit, and doesn't provide any tools to manage the layout of the components that make up your user interface on screen. Personally, I really appreciate the tree-based way we build UI in the browser with HTML and CSS. I especially like the [flexbox layout module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts), as it's very intuitive to reason around the placement of objects in flex-based layouts.

[Clay](https://www.nicbarker.com/clay) is a renderer-agnostic library created by the brilliant Nic Barker, and brings the joys of `<div class="flex">` soup to C developers. It's insanely cool, but I'll let Nic sell it to you:

<div style="padding-block: 2rem;">
