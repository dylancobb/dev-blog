This project was my first attempt at creating a semantic pitch encoding system that supports basic arithmetic operations. It works for all notated pitches encountered in Western music, and actually corresponds exactly to the ordering of pitches in [31-tone equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament)—something I was actually unaware of at the time, as I didn't conceive of this system with tuning systems other than 12-tone equal temperament in mind!

As neat as this system felt at the time, I came up with [Meantonal](../meantonal) very shortly afterwards, which is much more powerful, simpler to reason around, and really completely obviates this older method of representing pitches.

The website is a static site made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). No other libraries were used—all the components are hand-made.
